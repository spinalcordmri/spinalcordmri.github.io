> **Note**: This workshop is scheduled to be held in a “hybrid” format. Some speakers will present in-person (at the Martinos Center) while others may present virtually. Attendees are welcomed to attend in-person or virtually. For detailed information about the schedule of the workshop (including which of the talks will be held in-person), please visit the [Martinos Center](https://education.martinos.org/home/martinos-spinal-cord-workshop/) website.

The Martinos Spinal Cord Workshop is designed for researchers and clinicians who are interested in using MRI to study the human spinal cord. 
Imaging the spinal cord entails a number of complications compared to whole-brain imaging: the cord is a thin, flexible, 3-dimensional organ surrounded 
by pulsating cerebrospinal fluid and a complex vertebral structure. We hope to spare you various pitfalls and failures based upon our many years of 
experience in spinal cord imaging.
