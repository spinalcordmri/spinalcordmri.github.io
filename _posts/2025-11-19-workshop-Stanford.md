Stanford will be hosting a three-day Spinal Cord Workshop on November 19-21, 2025. The workshop will cover structural and functional spinal cord imaging acquisition and analysis. 

In addition to expert-led lectures, the in-person experience offers unique opportunities you wonâ€™t want to miss: hands-on training and analysis sessions, hands-on scanning at GE and Siemens scanners, and engaging social events. Participants will also be listed as course alumni and receive a course completion certificate.
