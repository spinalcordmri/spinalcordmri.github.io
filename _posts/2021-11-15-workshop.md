The Martinos Spinal Cord Workshop is designed for researchers and clinicians who are interested in using MRI to study the human spinal cord. Imaging the spinal cord entails a number of complications compared to whole-brain imaging: the cord is a thin, flexible, 3-dimensional organ surrounded by pulsating cerebrospinal fluid and a complex vertebral structure. We hope to spare you various pitfalls and failures based upon our many years of experience in spinal cord imaging.
