### Program

For this year's workshop, we have organized a challenge: the goal is to come up with the best acquisition sequence & parameters for visualizing the spinal cord gray matter on 3T and/or 7T systems. This challenge will result in a consensus publication and open-access MRI protocols. More details [here](https://goo.gl/4YZTJd).
